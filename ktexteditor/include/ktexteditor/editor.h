/**
 * \brief Accessor interface for Editor part.
 *
 * Topics:
 *  - \ref editor_intro
 *  - \ref editor_config
 *  - \ref editor_notes
 *  - \ref editor_extensions
 *
 * \section editor_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Editor part can be accessed via the KTextEditor::Factory or the
 * KTextEditor::EditorChooser and provides
 * general information and configuration methods for the Editor
 * implementation, for example KAboutData by using aboutData().
 *
 * The Editor implementation has a list of all opened documents. Get this
 * list with documents(). To create a new Document call createDocument(). The
 * signal documentCreated() is emitted whenever the Editor created a new
 * document.
 *
 * \section editor_config Editor Configuration
 *
 * The config dialog can be shown with configDialog().
 * Instead of using the config dialog, the config
 * pages can be embedded into the application's config dialog. To do this,
 * configPages() returns the number of
 * config pages the Editor implementation provides and configPage() returns
 * the requested page. Further, a config page has a short descriptive name,
 * get it with configPageName(). You can get more detailed name by using
 * configPageFullName(). Also every config page has a pixmap, get it with
 * configPagePixmap(). The configuration can be saved and loaded with
 * readConfig() and writeConfig().
 *
 * \note We recommend to embedd the config pages into the main application's
 *       config dialog instead of using a separate config dialog, if the config
 *       dialog does not look cluttered then. This way, all settings are grouped
 *       together in one place.
 *
 * \section editor_notes Implementation Notes
 *
 * Usually only one instance of the Editor exists. The Kate Part
 * implementation internally uses a static accessor to make sure that only one
 * Kate Part Editor object exists. So several factories still use the same
 * Editor.
 *
 * readConfig() and writeConfig() should be forwarded to all loaded plugins
 * as well, see KTextEditor::Plugin::readConfig() and
 * KTextEditor::Plugin::writeConfig().
 *
 * \section editor_extensions Editor Extension Interfaces
 *
 * There is only a single extension interface for the Editor: the
 * CommandInterface. With the CommandInterface it is possible to add and
 * remove new command line commands which are valid for all documents. Common
 * use cases are for example commands like \e find or setting document
 * variables. For further details read the detailed descriptions in the class
 * KTextEditor::CommandInterface.
 *
 * \see KTextEditor::Factory, KTextEditor::Document, KTextEditor::ConfigPage
 *      KTextEditor::Plugin, KTextEditor::CommandInterface
